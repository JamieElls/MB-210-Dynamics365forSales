Module 1: Configure Dynamics 365 Sales
========================

## Practice Lab n.n - Create leads

Scenario
--------

World Wide Importers (WWI) is looking to formalize their sales process to
increase revenue and give leadership, the stronger forecasting abilities. You are
a functional consultant configuring Dynamics 365 for Sales for World Wide
Importers. In this lab, you will install the Sales application and install
sample data.

In this Module 0 lab, you will validate that your classroom tenant is working as expected. You will access your individual credentials, record your “alias”, and open the Dynamics 365 model-driven application that we will be using throughout the course. 

**Important Note:** This lab will provide you with an actual Dynamics 365 tenant
and licenses for the Power Platform applications you will be using in this
course. Please be aware that the Power Platform is evolving all the time. The
instructions in this document may be different from what you experience in your
actual tenant. It is also possible to experience a delay of several
minutes before the virtual machine has network connectivity to begin the labs.
