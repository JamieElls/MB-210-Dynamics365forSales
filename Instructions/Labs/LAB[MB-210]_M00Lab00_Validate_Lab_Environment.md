Module 1: Configure Dynamics 365 Sales
========================

## Practice Lab 1.1 - Validate lab environment 

Scenario
--------

World Wide Importers (WWI) is looking to formalize their sales process to
increase revenue and give leadership, the stronger forecasting abilities. You are
a functional consultant configuring Dynamics 365 for Sales for World Wide
Importers. In this lab, you will install the Sales application and install
sample data.

In this Module 0 lab, you will validate that your classroom tenant is working as expected. You will access your individual credentials, record your “alias”, and open the Dynamics 365 model-driven application that we will be using throughout the course. 

**Important Note:** This lab will provide you with an actual Dynamics 365 tenant
and licenses for the Power Platform applications you will be using in this
course. Please be aware that the Power Platform is evolving all the time. The
instructions in this document may be different from what you experience in your
actual tenant. It is also possible to experience a delay of several
minutes before the virtual machine has network connectivity to begin the labs.

Exercise 1 - Access the Dynamics 365 application

### Task 1 – Log into the Power Platform admin center

1. Access <https://admin.Powerplatform.microsoft.com> and log in with your user credentials.

1. Record your user credential up to the **@** symbol on a scratch piece of paper or in Notepad. This will be your lab alias that you will use to differentiate the data you create within the shared Dynamics 365 organization.

**Important:** Please be aware that this tenant and the Dynamics 365 organization will be shared with the other students in your classroom, like employees would share a tenant when using the Dynamics 365 instance belonging to their organization. Do not use any PII (personally identifiable information) when creating records. It is also good practice to use your username prefix (ex., **mollyc**) in front of all records, data, apps, flows, etc. you create.

1. Feel free to explore the Power Platform admin center but **do not make any changes.**
